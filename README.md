# broken_tools

when a tool breaks, instead of it disappearing, it turns into an unusable "broken" version. the broken version
can be repaired on an anvil.

currently only compatible with "normal"-type tools used to break blocks, tools from mods which define custom behavior
(e.g. hoes) may not wear tools in a compatible way.
